"""Feature engineering and retrieval logic for the Gift Recommendation System.

Imported by both the training notebook and the FastAPI service. joblib pickles
reference functions by module path, so logic defined only inside a notebook
(``__main__``) fails to unpickle in the API process. Keeping it here makes the
artefact portable and guarantees train/serve parity.

Changes from v1, each driven by a measured defect:

* ``budget_tolerance`` defaults to **0.0**. v1 shipped 0.10, so a 200 SAR
  request could return a 220 SAR item while the evaluation asserted against
  ``budget * 1.10`` — the same expression the filter used. That assertion was
  tautological and could not fail.
* Occasion and gender are **scored, not filtered**. As filters they emptied
  results for rare occasions and hard-coded a gender stereotype into
  admissibility.
* Occasion and interest dimensions are **weighted by inverse label frequency**.
  A label covering 98% of the catalogue carries no ranking information;
  without weighting it competed on equal terms with one covering 6%.
* Score ties are broken by a **query-seeded jitter**. v1's deterministic prior
  made only the single prior-winning item of each duplicate profile reachable,
  capping catalogue coverage at 4%.
